# Discord-JDA-Poker-Bot
This is my first Maven project using Eclipse. My goal is to convert the turn based, command prompt poker game that I coded into a Discord Poker bot. A large portion of the code needs to be re-written since the it will be driven by Event Listeners rather than simple step based input output using the Scanner/Print methods.

Some of the Cardgame class methods can be used without being re-written entirely however these methods need some serious debugging.
